# Status
This SDK is NOT maintained or supported by Microsoft even though we've contributed to it in the past. Note that Azure Monitor only provides support when using the [supported SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/platforms#unsupported-community-sdks). Weâ€™re constantly assessing opportunities to expand our support for other languages, so follow our [GitHub Announcements](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Announcements/issues) page to receive the latest SDK news.
